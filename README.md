OIBSIP Internship – Data Science Task 1: Iris Flower Classification
# OIBSIP Python Task 1

##  Objective
This task is part of the Oasis Infobyte Internship Program (OIBSIP).  
The goal of Task 1 is to 
Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their
measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to
their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the
measurements of the iris species and classify them.


Although the Scikit-learn library provides a dataset for iris flower classification, you can also
download the same dataset from here for the task of iris flower classification with Machine
Learning. 
It demonstrates basic Python programming, logical thinking, and problem-solving.

##  Steps Performed
1. Analyzed the problem requirements.
2. Designed a solution approach.
3. Implemented the solution in Python (`task_1.py`).
4. Tested the code with sample inputs.
5. Documented the results.

## ⚙Tools Used
- Python 3.11.9  
- Code Editor: VS Code / PyCharm / Jupyter Notebook (mention the one you used)  
- Git & GitHub for version control  

## Outcome
- Successfully implemented the program in Python.
- The script runs as expected and produces the desired output.
- Key learning: improved Python programming, Git workflow, and documentation skills.

##  How to Run
1.Dataset:Iris (1).csv
2.Run the script:
```bash
python task_1.py
